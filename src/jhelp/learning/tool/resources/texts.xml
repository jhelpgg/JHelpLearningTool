	<!-- Tutorial step 1 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep1">
 		Hello and welcome to this learning tool.
 		The aim of this tool is to learn you some basics of code.
 		First we presents this interface and then give you some exercise.
 		Just remember that learn is understand by yourself,
 		and the better way for that is to try things by yourself.
 		This tool will draw things.
 		On the left, you see load, save and new buttons.
 		Under them, you see some buttons to change the point of view.
 		You can try them at any time.
 		In middle you see a white paper with a spaceship over it.
 		The code you will enter, will pilot the spaceship.
 		With this spaceship, you can draw things on paper.
 		Note : mouse wheel change the zoom on scene.
 		On the right its the code zone.
 		--Click to see next page--
	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 2 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep2">
 		The code zone presents the set of instructions that spaceship understand.
 		A GO button, that order spaceship to follow instructions.
 		A white area, in it will find the list of spaceship instructions.
 		Instructions are execute in order, from top to bottom.
 		To add an instruction in the list, click on one available.
 		First exercise, click on #FORWARD# forward button, type 100 in edit text.
 		You will see the #FORWARD# forward action on the instruction list.
 		Then press GO button to give the order to spaceship.
 		See what append.
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--
	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 3 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep3">
 		What did you see ?
 		The spaceship went forward its current direction for 100 pixels.
 		In doing that it makes a draw, so its draw a line.
 		Its possible to not draw on putting pen up.
 		Now click on #ROTATE# rotate button, then type 45 in edit text.
 		Add click on #FORWARD# forward button, type 100 in edit text (Yes a second time).
 		Then press GO button to give the order to spaceship.
 		See what append.
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--
	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 4 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep4">
 		Now the spaceship go 100 step forward,
 		then rotate 45 degree (counter clockwise),
 		then forward 100 steps again.
 		Now right click on the #ROTATE# 45 inside instruction list.
 		It becomes red, that's mean you can manipulate it.
 		Press C, you will see a second a second one, you just do a copy.
 		Now press down button until the #ROTATE# 45 is the last one.
 		Do also a copy of a #FORWARD# 100 and put it at end.
 		You  should have, form top to bottom :
 		#FORWARD# 100, #ROTATE# 45, #FORWARD# 100, #ROTATE# 45, #FORWARD# 100
 		Then press GO button to give the order to spaceship.
 		See what append.
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--
	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 5 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep5">
 		Now talk about speed.
 		If you feel at ease and thinks spaceship goes to slow you can add #FAST# at first instruction.
 		If you want be sure to see all space ship movement add #SLOW# at first instruction.
 		For delete an instruction, select it by right click then press delete or suppr button.
 		Do your own test and see the difference.
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--
	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 6 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep6">
 		Add a #HOME# instruction at end,
 		Then a #PEN_UP# pen up, #ROTATE# 22, #FORWARD# 50.
 		Change pen color with #COLOR#, choose the color you want.
 		And add #FILL#.
 		Instructions you have now looks like, form top to bottom :
 		#SLOW#, #FORWARD# 100, #ROTATE# 45, #FORWARD# 100, #ROTATE# 45, #FORWARD# 100,
 		#HOME#, #PEN_UP#, #ROTATE# 22, #FORWARD# 50, #COLOR#, #FILL#
 		Then press GO button to give the order to spaceship.
 		See what append.
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--
	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 7 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep7">
 		Now a tip, imagine you are not satisfied about #FORWARD# or #ROTATE# value,
 		or the color in #COLOR# not fit, you can go on edit mode and press space.
 		For next exercise, change the color of #COLOR# without delete it and add a new one.
 		Remember to go in edit mode, just right click on element to edit
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--

	<!-- Tutorial step 8 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep8">
 		Before do this exercise, save your work to be able to comes back on it.
 		Add lot of time same instruction (by example #NORMAL#) until you see only them.
 		Your work is still their (You can press GO button for have a proof).
 		For scroll, put your mouse over instruction list, press left button and go down or up.
 		When you understood the scrolling, you can get back to your work on loading it.
 		--To continue tutorial, click on continue button--
 	</Text>

	<!-- Tutorial step 9 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep9">
 		Now clear all your work to do something different (White button right save button).
 		Use what you learn to :
 		Draw a square of 100 steps on each side.
 		Fill it in red.
		You can found a solution on opening the "9" file.
		But I recommend to try first before look solution.

	<!-- Tutorial step 10 -->
 	<Text key="TutorialStep10">
 		Congratulation you reach the end of this tutorial.
 		You will find some samples (in open) that show you what can be done with little patience and geometry.
 		Have fun on driving the space ship and try things not explain here.
 		For going further, I work on an other tool, with "loops" and "functions" for doing more complex things.
